**Assignment 4 - Data Preprocessing and Data Visualization**

This assignment works with the Large Movie Review Dataset and uses deep learning to perform Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves the implementation of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to detect the sentiment of written text with a binary measurement: positive or negative. Given the time constraints, only the data preprocessing portion of this project was implemented, which involves cleaning and processing the `train_raw_data.csv` and `test_raw_data.csv` CSV files for training and testing the LSTM model.

## Usage

Run the `data_preprocessing_main.py` file using `Python3.10` and the following command:

```bash
python3.10 data_preprocessing_main.py
```

## Package Dependencies

The `data_preprocessing_main.py` file makes use of the following packages:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
